Feature: Documentation meta is generated after publishing
  In order to help users find relevant information quicker
  As a documentation contributor
  I want documentation meta to be available after publishing

  Meta:
  - Documentation package name and update time
  - Links to other published versions of documentation
  - Link to the current documentation page editor
